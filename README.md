# Appointment Planner React Project

This project was created for Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Course. The objective was to utilize React components to build a functional app. The app features two main pages: one for adding and viewing contacts, and another for creating and viewing appointments.

## Technology 

1. React
2. HTML
3. CSS

## Potential Upgrade Ideas

2. Improve the form styling.
3. Save data to database, associated with user login
